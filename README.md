### Let's Start a Journey from Basics to Advance in Python [Zero0Ô∏è‚É£ to Heroü¶∏]
Let's cover Basics and then intermediate and then let's play with Datasets with numpy library and after heading towards plotting charts with matplotlib library in Pythonüêç

### Roadmap
- Cover Basics
- Numbers
- Variables
- Lists
- Tuples and Dictionary
- Strings and it's functions
- Conditional Statements
- Iterative Loops
- Practice Questions
- Reading Files [.txt and .cv files]
- Moving towars numpy and pandas
- Open CV
- Further we will head towards AI and ML modules

### Working with Face Detection using OpenCV
You need to download <strong>Haar Cacade Face Recognition and Eye Recognition .xml files </strong> either from my <a href="https://github.com/ShahStavan/Python">Python Repo</a> or from <a href="https://github.com/ShahStavan/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades">opencv</a>. <br>
Code : <a href="https://github.com/ShahStavan/Python/blob/main/facedetection.py">Face Detection</a> <br>
For Further Help : <a href="https://machinelearningknowledge.ai/face-detection-with-haar-cascade-in-opencv-python/"> Face Detection with HAAR Cascade in OpenCV Python </a>
